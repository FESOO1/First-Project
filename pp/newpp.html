        <p>I have a pet. It is a dog and I call it brownie
            Brownies is a Chinese breed. It is small, fluffy
            and cute. It has got thick brown fur. When I
            cuddle it, the fur feels soft. Brownie does not
            like bones. Every day it east soft food like
            steamed rice, fish or bread. Every morning I
            give her milk and bread. When I am at school.
            Brownie plays with my cat. They get along
            well, and never fight maybe because Brownie
            does not bark a lot. It treats the other animals
            in our house gently, and it never eats shoes.
            Brownie is really a sweet and friendly animal
