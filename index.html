        <p>If you have the right tool, you can easily find information about a person for your personal or professional use. Maybe you lost contact with your old friend and want to reconnect with them or find a relative. There are lookup tools available that will help you get relevant information. Businesses and landlords can use these tools to do background checks on a person to check if the person is who they claim to be or do they have any criminal records, etc.</p>
